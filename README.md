# ADLC Team Skills

Agent skills for the [Twelve-Factor Agentic SDLC](https://github.com/tikalk/agentic-sdlc-12-factors) workflow — team directives management, product decision records, and architecture analysis.

**Relationship to 12 factors:** This repo is referenced from [team-ai-directives](https://github.com/tikalk/agentic-sdlc-team-ai-directives) and together with the 12-factor methodology forms the Foundation layer of the ADLC stack. The skills implement Factors III, IV, IX, X, XI, and XII.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install skills globally
npx skills add tikalk/adlc-team-skills -a claude -g

# Or for a specific project
npx skills add tikalk/adlc-team-skills -a claude
```

Works with any agent that supports the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io) — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others.

**Before anything else:** Run `team-setup` once to configure the team AI directives path, or ensure `.adlc/init-options.json` is present.

## #1: The Agent Doesn't Know How Your Team Works

**Factor X — Context Engineering. Factor XI — Directives as Code. Factor XII — Team Capability.**

An agent assigned to your repo has no idea about your team's coding conventions, review standards, architectural principles, or product strategy. Without structured context injection, every session starts from zero — and every session drifts.

`team-boot` loads the team constitution, PDR and ADR indexes, and relevant context modules automatically on session start. `team-discover` retrieves the specific personas, rules, and examples relevant to the current task. No prompt walls, no manual context dumping.

```
team-boot      → auto-loads constitution + PDR/ADR indexes + discover
team-discover  → fetches rules/personas/examples for the current task
team-constitution → create or amend the team constitution interactively
team-repair    → re-index CDR.md, scan for conflicts, verify freshness
```

---

## #2: Lessons From Sessions Evaporate

**Factor IX — Traceability. Factor XI — Directives as Code. Factor XII — Team Capability.**

Every agent session surfaces patterns, gotchas, and team knowledge. Without a structured capture mechanism, that knowledge is lost when the session ends.

LevelUp skills capture session traces, extract reusable Context Directive Records (CDRs), and publish them back to the team AI directives repository as skills, rules, personas, or examples — creating a closed feedback loop where every session enriches the next.

```
levelup-trace    → generate session execution trace
levelup-specify  → extract CDRs from trace + evidence
levelup-clarify  → review, accept, reject, or defer CDRs
levelup-publish  → compile into team directives + draft PR
```

## #3: Product Decisions Are Invisible

**Factor III — Mission Definition.**

Without documented product decisions, every implementation session re-derives (or misinterprets) the product's intent. Feature scope, target audience, business constraints, and trade-offs are locked in someone's head or buried in a Slack thread.

Product skills capture product decisions as individual PDR files, refine them through a clarification workflow, and compile them into a self-contained PRD.md. The `product-roadmap` skill tracks milestone progress from decisions through execution, evidence, and gates — with live issue counting via MCP.

```
product-init      → discover PDRs from existing codebase/docs (brownfield)
product-specify   → create PDRs interactively (greenfield)
product-clarify   → refine, validate, and approve PDRs
product-implement → generate PRD.md from accepted PDRs
product-analyze   → check PDR↔PRD consistency
product-roadmap   → track milestone progress (decisions + issues + code + gates)
```

---

## #4: Architecture Decisions Are Invisible

**Factor IV — Structured Planning.**

Unrecorded architecture decisions produce inconsistent implementations, duplicated effort, and systems that are harder to maintain or evolve. The adage "the architecture is in the code" is only true if you're willing to reverse-engineer every decision from the source.

Architecture skills capture Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and compose them into a unified Architecture Description (AD) using the Rozanski & Woods viewpoints methodology.

```
architect-init      → reverse-engineer ADRs from codebase (brownfield)
architect-specify   → create ADRs from PRD or feature description (greenfield)
architect-clarify   → refine and validate ADRs
architect-implement → generate AD.md from accepted ADRs
architect-analyze   → check ADR↔AD consistency and quality
```

---

## #5: End-to-End Feature Work Spans Many Skills

**Factor III — Mission Definition. Factor XIII — Loop Engineering.**

A real feature isn't one skill — it's specify → plan → tasks → implement ↔
converge, with gates, a circuit breaker, resume across sessions, and an audit
trail. Orchestrating that by hand is error-prone and loses state on every
compaction. `mission-brief` structures the description into a Mission Brief
(goal, constraints, success criteria), generates an ordered step list with
prompts that trigger installed SDD skills via model invocation or command-file
discovery, and walks those steps to converged implementation. No YAML workflow
files, no per-framework profiles — the step prompts use canonical SDD
terminology that works with any installed skill set. Supports 30+ agents via
externalized command discovery (`references/agent-integrations.md`).

```
mission-brief            → brief → generate steps → run end-to-end (sync default, --async across sessions)
mission-brief --resume   → continue an interrupted mission from the persisted checkpoint
```

Runs sync (interactive, gated) or async (ungated, checkpoint across sessions),
with a converge loop, circuit breaker, spec-correction routing (config-gated),
per-step model tiers, and a `mission-log.json` audit trail.
